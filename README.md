It's recommended you use GNOME or Cinnamon as your desktop environment, though others might work.
KDE Plasma is known not to allow the overlay to be drawn above the game.

**1. Install dependencies**

    sudo apt install git cmake g++ gcc xorg-dev libudev-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libinput-dev libsoil-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev

    cd glfw
    mkdir build

    sudo make install

**3. Navigate to directory for cheat files (I use /Documents/development/ for example)**

    cd ~/Documents/

**4. Clone repo**

    git clone https://github.com/hir0xygen/zap-client.git
