## :card_file_box: Installation
<details>
<summary><b>View installation guide</b></summary>

It's recommended you use GNOME or Cinnamon as your desktop environment, though others might work.
KDE Plasma is known not to allow the overlay to be drawn above the game.

**1. Install dependencies**

    sudo apt install git cmake g++ gcc xorg-dev libudev-dev libglu1-mesa-dev libxrandr-dev libxinerama-dev libxcursor-dev libxi-dev libxkbcommon-dev libwayland-dev libinput-dev libsoil-dev build-essential libx11-dev libxtst-dev

**2. Build glfw**

    git clone https://github.com/glfw/glfw.git
    cd glfw
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    sudo make install

**3. Navigate to directory for cheat files (I use `/Documents/development/` for example)**

    cd ~/Documents/

**4. Clone repo**

    git clone https://github.com/hir0xygen/zap-client.git
    cd zap-client

**5. Build & Run**

    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make
    chmod +x run.sh
    ./run.sh

**6. Press insert to toggle the menu (you can only interact with the menu and the game when the menu is active)**
**Note: You will need to tab between the cheat overlay and Apex**  
**If the overlay is not vertically aligned correctly (watermark is not all the way in the top-left corner, ESP misaligned), you can hold SUPER + Left-Mouse-Button and then drag it upwards on most desktop environments.**
